# Contribution

If you want to contribute there are a few things to note:
1. The use of AI to help in any way is prohibited, get a human to help.
2. You should use Twine with the story format of SugarCube (This is for consistency).
3. Comments should use /\*C-Style, Block*/ format.
4. You must ensure that the information is accurate.
5. You must specify the mod version.
6. Only SFW mods are allowed.
7. Do not include recipies in images unless they are not obvious or there is only one. (This is to reduce clutter)
	* If you get raw **\<Material>** from a raw **\<Material>** block, do not include the recipe.
	* If you get raw **\<Material>** from using **\<Material>** ore on a stonecutter, do include that recipe.
	* If you get **\<Material>** armor the same way you get **\<Default Minecraft Material>** armor, do include that recipe.
	* Include all recipies in text.
8. Only one recipe image should be displayed at any time.
9. All information should be publicly accessable and verifiable.
